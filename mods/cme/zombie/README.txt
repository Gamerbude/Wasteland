===============================
Copyright (c) 2015-2016 BlockMen <blockmen2015@gmail.com>

Version: 2.0 Beta


Adds zombies to Minetest (requires Creatures MOB-Engine).
Zombies can spawn to every day-time in the world as long there it is dark enough.
You will find some in caves, dark forests and ofc a lot at night.
If they notice any player near they will attack.
Zombies have 20 HP (like players) and drop rotten flesh randomly.
